This is a repo for me to document my journey taking the tensorflow development certification exam!!

I am trying to document everything I do for the exam, including code to help with my learning! I am giving myself 6 months to try and complete the exam as I am starting pretty much from scratch with this exam (I don't have that much experience with tensorflow), so hopefully this will be a good learning resource for other people.

I think you need at least a basic knowledge of python (at least oop and functional programming in python) and probably data manipulation in python to do the exam. If you don't have any of these maybe learn a bit about python, pandas and numpy before continuing as this repo won't cover this. 


## Resources I am using.
I am trying to use a variety of resources for this exam (some are free, some I have paid for):

- Canidates Handbook (https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf). This is the curriculum so is essential!! I will try to organise the repo around this.
- TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice). Online people who have passed the exam say that this is an essential resource.
- Deeplearn.ai neural networks and deeplearning specialization (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0). This goes through neural net theory and tensorflow recommends this on their website.
- 3blue1brown maths playlists on youtube (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab). Tensorflow recommend this on their website.
- AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence by Laurence Moroney. I have to do long commutes on trains and it's nice to have something to read...
- TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2021: Zero to Mastery from udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/). Udemy massively overcharge for their courses but do regular sales (at least once month) when stuff can be really cheap.


## Finally

I hope this repo can help others but this repo is primairly aimed to help my learning. I am a linux user so I am doing everything on linux. I can't answer technical questions on how to install tensorflow etc on mac/windows etc (look on stack overflow for this stuff!!).
