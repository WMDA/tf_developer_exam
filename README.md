This is a repo for me to document my journey taking the tensorflow development certification exam!!

I am trying to document everything I do for the exam, including code to help with my learning! I am giving myself 6 months to try and complete the exam as I am starting pretty much from scratch (I don't have that much experience with tensorflow) with this exam so hopefully this will be a good learning resource for other people as well.

## A bit about this repo.
Though I am new to tensorflow I am not new to python, pandas, numpy, sckit-learn and scipy. From what I understand I think you need at least a basic knowledge of python (at least oop and functional programming in python) and probably data manipulation in python to do the exam. If you don't have any of these maybe learn a bit about python, pandas and numpy before continuing as this repo won't cover this. 

The exam also doesn't seem to test you on neural network basic maths (I am english and it is maths not math!!) but my personal opinion is that understanding what the neural network is doing on a rudimental level is essential. This repo may cover some of the basics of neural networks maths but this is not the primary aim so maybe take a few courses on this stuff.

## Resources I am using.
I am trying to use a variety of resources for this exam (some are free, some I have paid for):

- Canidates Handbook (https://www.tensorflow.org/extras/cert/TF_Certificate_Candidate_Handbook.pdf). This is the curriculum so is essential!! I will try to organise the repo around this and this is free.
- TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice). I am using the free version of this at the moment but this course seems pretty essential to the exam.
-  Deeplearn.ai neural networks and deeplearning specialization (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0). I am using this to help my understanding of the theory of the exam. I like the youtube version of this as I am subscribed to too many courses on coursera.
-  AI and Machine Learning for Coders: A Programmer's Guide to Artificial Intelligence by Laurence Moroney. I bought the kindle version of this as I have to do long commutes on trains (often without phone signal, stupid London underground!) so this allows me to do something while commuting.
- TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2021: Zero to Mastery from udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/). A tip with udemy is they massively overcharge for their courses but do regular sales (at least once month) with massive discounts. I got this course for £13.99 rather than £59.99.


## Finally

I hope this repo can help others but this repo is primairly aimed to help my learning. I am a linux user so I will explain everything on linux and won't show how to do stuff on mac or windows. I can't answer technical questions on how to install tensorflow on mac/windows etc (look on stack overflow for this stuff!!).
